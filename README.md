The assembly program towers.s mimics the C++ program towers.cpp to solve the towers of hanoi puzzle.

And output the step of each move as well as the total number of move.

The assembly and cpp programs prompt ```Enter the number of disks to be moved:  ``` to request the user to enter an integer. This is slightly different than the output.txt which use  discs instead of disks.
